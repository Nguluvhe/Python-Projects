## Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

```python
if 5 > 2:  
  print("Five is greater than two!")
```

## Python Variables

In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

### Example Variables

Variables in Python:

```python
x = 5  
y = "Hello, World!"
```

## Comments

Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

### Example Comments

Comments in Python:

```python
#This is a comment.  
print("Hello, World!")
```
